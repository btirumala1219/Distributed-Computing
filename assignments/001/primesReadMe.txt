- The assignment was done in "go"
- To run "go" must be installed and must be in your path

Steps:
1) cd into the directory with the file "primes.go"
2) type "go run primes.go"
3) an output.txt will be created with the specified outputs

Note:
- I had a tough time getting it to be efficient past 1,000,000
so 1,000,000 is the default setting
- Attempting 100,000,000 takes about 21 minutes
- You will also notice that the prompt will have outputs saying "wrote __ bytes"
this is just specifying the number of bytes written to the file at one time.
