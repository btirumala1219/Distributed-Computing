## Course Outline
This course is designed to provide a comprehensive presentation of the principles and tools available for programming parallel machines. The paradigm shift in the core computing architecture requires a fundamental change in how we program. The art of multiprocessor programming, currently mastered by few, is complex and requires understanding of new computational principles, algorithms, and programming tools. While parallel programming is of significant theoretical and industrial importance, there are few books addressing how to approach this challenging problem. Most engineers must learn intricate details of multi-processor synchronization through a frustrating trial and error process. The goal of the course is to enable the students to master the state-of-the-art modern programming techniques in concurrent programming as well as gain a solid knowledge base in the fundamental concepts of parallel computing.

## Course Topics
Introduction to the core concepts of concurrent programming, design and implementation of concurrent algorithms and data structures, lock-free synchronization, programming tools and techniques for parallel computing, emerging parallel programming models, recent advances and future trends in concurrent programming, validation and verification of parallel processes, industrial applications.

## Reference Guide
The textbook for the course is: The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, Nir Shavir and Maurice Herlihy, Revised First Edition, Morgan Kaufmann 2012.

## Style of Class Meetings
The class meetings will not consist of traditional lectures, with the instructor doing most of the talking and the student doing most of the listening. Rather, meetings will consist of discussions on each topic and the instructor will help guide the discussion by asking questions.

## Grading Policy
* (40%) Programming Assignments
* (40%) Homework Assignments and Solution Presentation
* (10%) Quizzes
* (10%) Data Structure Project Presentation

**Letter grades**: 90-100: A, 80-89: B, 70-79: C, 50-69: D, Below 50: F.

**Note**: Any academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, Cheating, copying and/or plagiarism) with respect to any exam or assignment in this class will result in a grade of F, following by the usual procedures for dealing with such behavior, as describe in the UCF Golden Rule : a handbook for students.
